# Data Grid


Hello Mosaic,

First and foremost, thank you for giving me the opportunity to earn a spot on your team. I genuinely believe that I will be a great addition to the company. To get started, please run npm install to download dependencies, npm start to start the server and npm run build in another to start up webpack. I made quite a bit of change to the existing code but left comments throughout to help you better understand my thought process.

This prompt was undoubtedly a challenge, but I had an extremely fun experience troubleshooting and getting all parts to run smoothly without any bugs.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any issues getting the application started. I look forward to hearing back from your team.
